CKAN Store Publisher [![Build Status](https://build.conwet.fi.upm.es/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=ckan_storepublisher)](https://build.conwet.fi.upm.es/jenkins/job/ckan_storepublisher/)
========================================================================================================================================================================================

CKAN extension that allows users to publish datasets in the FIWARE Store
(as offerings) in a simpler way. To do so, a new tab is added in the
Datasets *Manage* menu that offers a form to set the basic options of
the offering.

Offerings are **not** automatically published so the dataset creator
must access this form and complete it in order to publish the dataset in
the FIWARE Store.

**Note:** This software is intended to integrate a CKAN instance with
the FIWARE Store so it won't probably work with other Stores.

Requirements
------------

-   A CKAN instance able to connect to the FIWARE Store via HTTP(s)
-   [FIWARE Store v0.4 or higher](https://github.com/conwetlab/wstore/)
-   [OAuth2 CKAN
    Extension](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-oauth2/). This
    extension is needed since the requests sent to the Store must
    include the OAuth2 credentials to identify the user that is creating
    the offering.
-   Optional: [CKAN Private Dataset
    Extension](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets/)

Installation
------------

Install this extension in your CKAN instance is as easy as intall any
other CKAN extension.

-   Download the source from this GitHub repo.
-   Activate your virtual environment (generally by running
    `. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate`)
-   Install the extension by running `python setup.py install`
-   Modify your configuration file (generally in
    `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`) and add `storepublisher` in the
    `ckan.plugins` setting.
-   In the same config file, specify the location of FIWARE Store by
    adding the `ckan.storepublisher.store_url` setting. In addition, you
    must also set the Repository used by the store. To do so, add the
    `ckan.storepublisher.repository` setting
-   Restart your apache2 reserver (`sudo service apache2 restart`)
-   That's All!

Tests
-----

This sofware contains a set of test to detect errors and failures. You
can run this tests by running the following command:

    nosetests --ckan --with-pylons=test.ini ckanext/storepublisher/tests/

**Note:** The `test.ini` file contains a link to the CKAN
`test-core.ini` file. You will need to change that link to the real path
of the file in your system (generally
`/usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/test-core.ini`).

You can also generate coverage reports by running: \`\`\` nosetests
--ckan --with-xunit --with-pylons=test.ini ckanext/storepublisher/tests/
--with-coverage --cover-package=ckanext.storepublisher --cover-inclusive
--cover-erase . --cover-xml
