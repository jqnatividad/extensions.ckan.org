======================

The ckanext-lire (LInked RElationships) extension provide GUI interface for managing datasets relationships. Each dataset is represented via graphical element. It enables previewing existing relationships between datasets. Preview can be filtered by tag, group, organization or random number of datasets. If user escapes filtering, all datasets from portal and their relations will be loaded. With given datasets, user can: create, update and delete relationships between dataset and to select dataset for which he want to obtain semantic description. Semantic description of dataset in RDF is updated, and contains a part in which his relationships is appropriately shown.
