Deliverance is an HTTP proxy that can be used to request and render web pages from an external site (e.g. a CMS like Drupal, Wordpress). Pages will be loaded from the CMS url, re-styled according to a XML specification and delivered to the end user. This allows CKAN to provide CMS-managed content pages without the need to include CMS functionality.
