CKAN BAE Publisher
==================

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/FIWARE-TMForum/ckanext-baepublisher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FIWARE-TMForum/ckanext-baepublisher)
[![Coverage
Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/FIWARE-TMForum/ckanext-baepublisher/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/FIWARE-TMForum/ckanext-baepublisher?branch=master)

CKAN extension that allows users to publish datasets in the FIWARE
Business API Ecosystem GE as offerings in an easy way. To do so, a new
tab is added in the Datasets *Manage* menu that offers a form to set the
basic options of the offering.

Offerings are **not** automatically published so the dataset creator
must access this form and complete it in order to publish the dataset
using the FIWARE Business API Ecosystem.

**Note:** This software is intended to integrate a CKAN instance with
the FIWARE Business API Ecosystem and it won't work with other
Marketplaces/Stores.

Requirements
------------

-   A CKAN instance able to connect to the FIWARE Business API Ecosystem
    via HTTP(s)
-   [FIWARE/TMF Business API Ecosystem v5.4.0 or
    higher](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/Business-API-Ecosystem)
-   [OAuth2 CKAN
    Extension](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-oauth2/). This
    extension is needed since the requests sent to the BAE must include
    the OAuth2 credentials to identify the user that is creating the
    offering.
-   [CKAN Private Dataset
    Extension](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets/)

Installation
------------

Install this extension in your CKAN instance is as easy as intall any
other CKAN extension.

-   Activate your virtual environment (generally by running
    `. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate`)
-   Install the extension by running `pip install ckanext-baepublisher`
-   Modify your configuration file (generally in
    `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`) and add `baepublisher` in the
    `ckan.plugins` setting.
-   In the same config file, specify the location of FIWARE BAE to use
    by adding the `ckan.baepublisher.store_url` setting.
-   Restart your apache2 reserver (`sudo service apache2 restart`)
-   That's All!

Tests
-----

This sofware contains a set of test to detect errors and failures. You
can run this tests by running the following command:

    nosetests --ckan --with-pylons=test.ini ckanext/baepublisher/tests/

**Note:** The `test.ini` file contains a link to the CKAN
`test-core.ini` file. You will need to change that link to the real path
of the file in your system (generally
`/usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/test-core.ini`).

You can also generate coverage reports by running: \`\`\` nosetests
--ckan --with-xunit --with-pylons=test.ini ckanext/baepublisher/tests/
--with-coverage --cover-package=ckanext.baepublisher --cover-inclusive
--cover-erase . --cover-xml
