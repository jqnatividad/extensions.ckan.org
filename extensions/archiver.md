CKAN Archiver Extension
=======================

**Status:** Production

**CKAN Version:** 1.5.1+

Overview
--------

The CKAN Archiver Extension provides a set of Celery tasks for downloading and saving CKAN resources. It can be configured to run automatically, saving any new resources that are added to a CKAN instance (and saving any resources when their URL is changed). It can also be run manually from the command line in order to archive resources for specific datasets, or to archive all resources in a CKAN instance.

Installation
------------

Install the extension as usual, e.g. (from an activated virtualenv):

    $ pip install -e git+http://github.com/okfn/ckanext-archiver.git#egg=ckanext-archiver

Install the required libraries:

    $ pip install -r pip-requirements.txt

Configuration
-------------

1.  Enabling Archiver

    If you want the archiver to run automatically when a new CKAN resource is added, or the url of a resource is changed, then edit your CKAN config file (eg: development.ini) to enable the extension:

        ckan.plugins = archiver

    If there are other plugins activated, add this to the list (each plugin should be separated with a space).

    **Note:** You can still run the archiver manually (from the command line) on specific resources or on all resources in a CKAN instance without enabling the plugin. See section 'Using Archiver' for details.

2.  Other CKAN config options

    The following config variable should also be set in your CKAN config:

        ckan.site_url: URL to your CKAN instance

    This is the URL that the archive process (in Celery) will use to access the CKAN API to update it about the cached URLs. If your internal network names your CKAN server differently, then specify this internal name in config option ckan.site\_url\_internally.

    Optionally, the following config variables can also be set: :

        ckan.cache_url_root: URL that will be prepended to the file path and saved against the CKAN resource,
          providing a full URL to the archived file.

3.  Additional Archiver settings

    The following Archiver settings can be changed by creating a copy of `ckanext/archiver/default_settings.py` at `ckanext/archiver/settings.py`, and editing the variables:

        ARCHIVE_DIR: path to the directory that archived files will be saved
        to.
        MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH: the maximum size (in bytes) of files to archive.
        DATA_FORMATS: the data formats that are archived.
        USER_AGENT_STRING: the `User-Agent` header used when the archiver makes requests

    Alternatively, if you are running CKAN with this patch: <https://github.com/datagovuk/ckan/commit/83dcaf3d875d622ee0cd7f3c1f65ec27a970cd10> then you can instead add the settings to the CKAN config file as normal:

        ckanext-archiver.archive_dir
        ckanext-archiver.max_content_length
        ckanext-archiver.data_formats  (space separated)
        ckanext.archiver.user_agent_string

Using Archiver
--------------

First, make sure that Celery is running. For test/local use, you can do this by going to the CKAN root directory and typing:

    paster celeryd -c <path to CKAN config>

For production use, we recommend setting up Celery to run with supervisord. For more information see

> <http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/background-tasks.html>

The Archiver can be used in two ways:

1.  Automatically

    Install, enable and configure the plugin as described above. Any changes to resource URLs (either adding new or updating current URLs) in the CKAN instance will now call the archiver to try and download the resource.

2.  Manually

    From the ckanext-archiver directory run:

        paster archiver update [dataset] -c <path to CKAN config>

    Here `dataset` is an optional CKAN dataset name or ID. If given, all resources for that dataset will be archived.

    If omitted, all resources for all datasets will be archived.

    For a full list of manual commands run:

        paster archiver --help

Testing
-------

Tests should be run from the CKAN root directory (not the extension root).

    (pyenv)~/pyenv/src/ckan$ nosetests --ckan ../ckanext-archiver/tests/
